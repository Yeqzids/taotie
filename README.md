----

* “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasty” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taotie)

* Over the last few years, I have tried to collect useful resources for astrophysical research in several different ways.  Now, it seems a GitHub repo is the best solution. I will gradually transfer my notes and bookmarks here. This place is still heavily under construction. I will create a series of notes first, and I am thinking about what is the best way to organize them later.

* Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation.

* **Under Construction**:
    - This repo is still under heavy and frequent development. I am currently working on this as a weekend project.
    - I am not 100% happy about the organization, so please forgive me if the structure is not perfect, I am working on it.

* **Website**: I am also thinking about making a document-style website out of this repo. Please stay tuned.

* Since machine learning is becoming more and more important in astrophysics and cosmology, I am giving it an independent directory now.

- [Basics of machine learning](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/mlearning/machine_learning_basic.md)
    * Online books, courses, handbooks...right now there are too many of them, so this might not be your best choice.

## [Resources for a Specific Topic](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/topics)

* There is no way this is even close to a complete list.  It only reflects the interests of the author.  Contributions are welcomed, and will try to organize it better.
